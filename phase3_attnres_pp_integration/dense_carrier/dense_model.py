"""Block Attention Residuals — native dense Transformer (no Llama3 subclass).

Standalone implementation of Block AttnRes (Kimi Team, 2026,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.15031) as a torchtitan ``Decoder`` variant.
Previously this experiment subclassed ``Llama3Model`` /
``Llama3TransformerBlock``; that coupled the AttnRes evolution to a
specific dense family and made it awkward to pivot to the MoE shape
Kimi's production models use. The refactor keeps AttnRes entirely
under ``torchtitan/experiments/kimi_k3/``, inheriting only from the
shared ``Decoder`` / ``TransformerBlock`` bases in
``torchtitan/models/common/decoder.py`` — no dependency on the Llama3
model classes.

The block follows paper Figure 2: each sub-layer (attention, MLP)
reads its input via ``block_attn_res`` over the current ``blocks``
plus ``partial_block``. At a block start ``partial_block`` is
committed to ``blocks`` and reset, so the new block accumulates only
the output of the sub-layers inside it.

The model:

- First / non-PP stage: ``blocks`` is ``None``, so we start with an
  empty list and ``partial_block = tok_embeddings(tokens)``.
- Middle / last PP stage: ``blocks`` arrives as a stacked
  ``[N, B, T, D]`` tensor from the previous stage; we unstack for
  per-layer access.
- Last stage (``self.lm_head is not None``): apply a final
  cross-block aggregation, then ``norm`` and ``output`` to emit
  logits.
- Intermediate stage: return ``(partial_block, stacked_blocks)`` so
  ``PipelineStage`` P2P-sends both tensors.
- ``_return_only_new_blocks``: the cross-stage caching adapter
  toggles this to keep per-stage send size constant in ``stage_id``
  by shipping only this stage's committed blocks; the receiving
  adapter concatenates them with its cached prefix before handing
  the full list to the next stage's model.

    """Transformer block with Block AttnRes wrapping each sub-layer.

    Inherits from the shared ``TransformerBlock`` base (not Llama3-specific).
    The FFN branch is chosen per-layer from the block's Config:

    - ``config.moe`` set, ``config.feed_forward`` None → MoE layer (``self.moe``)
    - ``config.feed_forward`` set, ``config.moe`` None → dense layer
      (``self.feed_forward``)

    This mirrors DeepSeek-V3's block convention (``DeepSeekV3TransformerBlock``)
    so a model can use the DSv3 pattern of first-N-dense-then-MoE layers, or
    uniformly dense / uniformly MoE. The MoE module itself is torchtitan's
    shared ``torchtitan.models.common.moe.MoE``; no MoE code is duplicated
    here.

    Attention is whatever ``BaseAttention.Config`` subclass is given — the
    block duck-types on ``self.attention.forward``, so DSv3's MLA
    (``torchtitan.models.deepseek_v3.model.Attention``) and the standard
    GQA config both work.

    The four standard attribute names (``attention``, ``attention_norm``,
    ``ffn_norm``, plus one of ``moe`` / ``feed_forward``) are preserved so
    ``parallelize_llama`` / ``parallelize_deepseekv3`` / the TP / FSDP / AC /
    compile passes apply unchanged — they duck-type on those names, not on
    the concrete class.
