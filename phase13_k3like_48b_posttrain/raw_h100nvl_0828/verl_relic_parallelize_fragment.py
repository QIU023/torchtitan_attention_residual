"""Parallelism application for Kimi Linear models.

Supported parallelism dimensions:

* **FSDP2 full-shard** -- primary path, modeled on
  ``torchtitan.models.llama3.parallelize.apply_fsdp``. Adapted to Kimi's
  module names (``embed_tokens``, ``norm``, ``lm_head``, ``layers`` as
  ``nn.ModuleList``).
* **TP** -- DSv3-style plan in ``apply_tp_kimi_linear``, matched to
  Kimi's MLA + KDA + MoE layout. All boundary tensors use_local_output
  so PP send/recv, AttnRes stacking, and fla-core triton kernels see
  plain tensors.
* **CP** -- Ulysses-style (seq-local projections, one fused all-to-all
  seq<->head, full-sequence attention on the local head subset) inside
  each KDA/MLA module. The module boundary stays a seq-sharded plain
  tensor, which is what keeps CP composable with FSDP/TP/PP/EP. Requires
  ``context_parallel_load_balancer=None`` (enforced with a ValueError).
* **EP** -- Expert Parallel for KimiMoE via ``apply_ep_kimi_linear``;
  all-to-all dispatch/combine on the EP mesh.
* **PP** -- via the cross-stage cache adapter in ``pipeline_adapter.py``;
  PP rank assignment is in torchtitan core, scheduling in the
  ``pipeline_kimi_linear_with_cache_adapter`` wrapper.
* **torch.compile** -- per-decoder-layer compile via
  ``_apply_compile_kimi_linear``; MoE for-loop and fla-core triton ops
  are carved out.
* **Activation checkpointing** -- applied via the shared
  ``ActivationCheckpointingConfig.build().apply()`` path since the Kimi
  decoder layer registry matches the llama3 ``model.layers`` iteration
  pattern. Honors all upstream modes (``selective``, ``full``,
  ``memory_budget``, ``none``).

    """Patch ShortConvolution + FusedRMSNormGated forwards to be DTensor-safe.

    Both classes wrap fla-core triton kernels (``causal_conv1d``,
    ``fused_norm_gated``) that take raw tensor pointers and don't
    dispatch through DTensor. Under TP, KDA's self_attn is
    NoParallel-wrapped — child params are DTensor(Replicate) on tp_mesh
    and inputs arrive as DTensor too. Calling the triton kernel with
    DTensor crashes.

    The patch wraps each class's ``forward`` to:
    1. ``to_local`` the input ``x`` (preserving DTensor mesh+placements
       for re-wrap at the output) and any positional / keyword args
       that happen to be DTensors.
    2. Run the original forward unchanged. The forward calls the
       kernel with ``self.weight`` (still a DTensor on the module, but
       autograd-traced via to_local under the hood — see below) — so
       we additionally redirect ``self.weight`` access to its local
       view via a transient property override on the instance during
       the call.
    3. Re-wrap the output as DTensor on the same mesh+placements so the
       parent's (NoParallel) prepare_output hook receives a DTensor.

    Critically we do NOT swap ``self._parameters`` to a fresh
    ``nn.Parameter(local)`` — that would break autograd (the new
    parameter has no link back to the DTensor original, so kernel
    backward would write into a temporary local tensor and the
    DTensor's grad would never see the contribution). Instead we mask
    the attribute lookup so the kernel sees a plain ``self.weight`` for
    the duration of forward, but autograd's saved-tensors reference the
    local-view of the DTensor (which is differentiable through to_local).

    Patch is idempotent: ``cls._fla_orig_forward`` is set on first patch.

    """TP plan for kimi_linear, modeled on
    ``deepseek_v3/parallelize.py``.

    Design constraint: every module-boundary tensor in this model is a
    plain ``torch.Tensor`` (not DTensor). The motivation is composability
    with three subsystems that don't dispatch through DTensor:

    * **fla-core triton kernels** in :class:`KimiDeltaAttention`
      (``causal_conv1d`` inside ``ShortConvolution``, ``fused_kda_gate``,
      ``chunk_kda``, ``FusedRMSNormGated``) — opaque to DTensor.
    * **PP P2P send/recv** at AttnRes block boundaries — only plain
      Tensors are sendable; DTensor wrappers don't survive P2P.
    * **AttnRes ``torch.stack``** in :func:`block_attn_res` — stacking
      mixed plain/DTensor inputs raises ``mixed Tensor and DTensor``.

    To satisfy all three, every Colwise/Rowwise plan emits
    ``use_local_output=True`` (or ``output_layouts=Replicate()`` plus
    ``use_local_output=True``), and every NoParallel call passes
    ``local_output_grad_placements=(Replicate(),)`` so the output is
    converted back to a plain Tensor at the module boundary. The TP
    collectives still fire (Colwise → DTensor(Shard) inside Linear's
    forward, Rowwise → DTensor(Partial) → all-reduce → Replicate →
    to_local).

    Per-module wrapping (DSv3-aligned):

    * **Top-level**:
      - ``embed_tokens``: RowwiseParallel (vocab dim sharded; no SP).
      - ``norm``: NoParallel.
      - ``lm_head``: ColwiseParallel (vocab dim sharded; output local).
      - ``final_attn_res_proj`` / ``final_attn_res_norm`` (AttnRes
        only): NoParallel — output dim 1 / RMSNorm cannot be sharded.

    * **MLA layer (KimiMLAAttention)**:
      - ``q_proj``: ColwiseParallel (out = H * q_head_dim).
      - ``kv_a_proj_with_mqa``: NoParallel (DSv3 pattern — the output
        is split into two halves of different sizes, which is not
        compatible with sharding on the concatenated last dim).
      - ``kv_a_layernorm``: NoParallel (single-half normalization).
      - ``kv_b_proj``: ColwiseParallel (out = H * (qk_nope + v_head_dim)).
      - ``inner_attention``: prepare_module_input(use_local_output=True)
        with sequence-axis placements — strips DTensor wrapping before
        SDPA's mem-efficient cutlass kernel sees q/k/v.
      - ``o_proj``: RowwiseParallel (in_features sharded, output
        all-reduced + Replicate).

    * **KDA layer (KimiDeltaAttention)**: NOT TP-wrapped. KDA's body is
      almost entirely fla-core triton kernels; sharding heads requires
      a ring-recurrence variant of ``chunk_kda`` that fla-core doesn't
      provide. Leaving KDA self_attn unwrapped means its parameters
      remain plain Tensors (FSDP shards them on the FSDP axis,
      replicated across TP ranks — accepting compute redundancy on the
      TP axis for a clean kernel-safety story). The KDA forward
      defensively strips any incoming DTensor (see
      ``_to_local_if_dtensor`` in model.py).

    * **dense MLP**: gate_proj / up_proj ColwiseParallel; down_proj
      RowwiseParallel(output_layouts=Replicate(), use_local_output=True).

    * **MoE FFN**: NoParallel on the ``ffn`` container (EP handles the
      real parallelization on a separate axis).

    * **Per-layer norms** (``input_layernorm``, ``post_attention_layernorm``):
      NoParallel.

    * **AttnRes per-layer modules** (``attn_res_proj``, ``attn_res_norm``,
      ``mlp_res_proj``, ``mlp_res_norm``): NoParallel each.

    Collectives per forward pass (summed across layers):
    - 1 all-reduce per dense-MLP layer (down_proj rowwise)
    - 1 all-reduce per MLA layer (o_proj rowwise)
    - KDA layers fire no TP collectives.
    Plus the symmetric backward all-reduces.
